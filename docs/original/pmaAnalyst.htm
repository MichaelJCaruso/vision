<h3><a name="overview">Overview</a></h3>
<p>

Two add-ins have been defined that enable an analyst to dynamically
interact with Vision from within the Excel<sup>TM</sup> environment.
The <i>Extract</i> add-in provides the ability to download data
from Vision directly into your spreadsheet.
If you have installed it, the choice <i>Vision</i>
will appear in the menu bar at the top of your Excel spreadsheet.
The <i>VUpload</i> add-in provides the ability to upload data
to Vision directly from your spreadsheet.
If you have installed it, the choice <i>VUpload</i>
will appear in the menu bar to the right of the <i>Vision</i> choice.
If you do not see a choice, you will need to 
<a href="admInstExcel.htm">install the add-in.</a>
<p>
The first time you select an option from the <i>Vision</i> or
<i>VUpload</i> menu, you will be prompted for a password.
If you prefer, you can explicitly log in using the <i>Connect</i>
choice in the <i>Vision</i> menu.
You should supply your password for the VisionServer machine and
click <i>OK</i>.  
You will need to provide the password whenever you restart
Excel and after you
disconnect from Vision (using the <i>Disconnect</i> choice in the
<i>Vision</i> menu).

<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="upload">Uploading Data</a></h3>
<p>
The <i>VUpload</i> component allows you
to temporarily make private modifications to the database
using the available data feed formats.
You can use <i>VUpload</i> to modify existing data, create new
instances, and define new structures including new data feed formats.
Several data feeds are also available for controlling display aspects of the
applications you view through your browser.
When you exit Excel, your changes to the database are not saved.  
If you save your changes as one or more delimited text files,
they can be committed to the database
permanently by the Vision Administrator using the
<a href="pmaDBA.htm"><i>Vision Administrator Module</i></a>.
<p>

All loads are done by selecting a
<a href="pmaFeeds.htm"> predefined feed name</a> associated
with the type of data you wish to upload.
For example, if you want 
to load Company data, you use the feed named <i>CompanyMaster</i>.
The feed can be selected via a menu or included as part of a
range of data to upload.
<p>

When you have a small amount of data that is missing or needs to be updated, 
you can define it in a range and upload it.
In this example, the Companies <i>Comp1</i>, <i>Comp2</i>, and <i>Comp3</i> 
are missing from a database. 

<p>

<h3><a name="usage">Sample Usage</a></h3>
<p>
Vision data feeds provide a potent means for an analyst that wants
to use the Vision browser applications on dynamically generated
information.  For example, an analyst may want to create a composite
account on the fly that can be used as a benchmark for comparison
with an existing portfolio.  You can use the 
<a href="pma_CompositeAccountMaster.htm"><i>CompositeAccountMaster</i></a>
feed to define <b>CompositeAccount</b> instances and the
<a href="pma_CompositeAccountMembers.htm"><i>CompositeAccountMembers</i></a>
feed to update the composition of <b>CompositeAccounts</b> over time.
You can then run the <a href="pma_AccountCompare.htm">Account Comparison</a>
or the <a href="pma_AccountCharacteristics.htm">Characteristics </a>
application from the browser to compare these newly created
composites with other portfolios.
<p>

<h4>Creating Composite Accounts</h4>
<p>

To create instances for the <i>CompositeAccount</i> feed, the minimal headings that are required are id and name. 
In this example, the instances <i>Compo1</i>, <i>Compo2</i>, and <i>Compo3</i> are defined. 
<p>

<center>
<img src="composite1.gif" border=1 width=209 height=155 alt="Composite Account Master Selected">
</center>
<p>

1. Select the range. 
<p>
2. Select <i>Upload Data</i> from the menu. 
<p>
The diagnostics report should confirm that you have successfully loaded the data. 

<p>

You have now successfully created 3 instances of the class <i>CompositeAccount</i>. 
<p>

<h4>Creating Compostite Account Memberships</h4>

<p>
To create a <i>CompositeAccountMemberbership</i>, you must supply one or more
accounts(<i>memberId</i>) and <i>weights</i> for each composite (<i>groupId</i>) 
Optionally, you can include date as well.
<p>

<center>
<img src="composite2.gif" border=1 width=323 height=224 alt="Composite Account Membership Selected">
</center>
<p>


1. Select the Range.
<p>

2. Select Upload.
<p>

The diagnostics message box should indicate that you have created the instances that
make this relationship correspond to each other.

<p>
<h4>Running Composite Account Reports From the Browser</h4>
<p>

To see these newly created composites from the browser, do the following:
<p>

1. Select <i>Account</i> Reports.
<p>
2. Select the <i>Account Comparison</i> Report.
<p>

3. Enter <i>Compo1</i> in the <i>Account</i> text box, and <i>102</i> in the <i>VS</i> text box.
<p>

4. Select the <i>Submit</i> button
<p>

You should see the following output, comparing CompositeAccount <i>Compo1</i> to portfolio <i>102</i> broken down by sector.
<p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="workbook">Using the Sample Workbook</a></h3>
<p>

The Sample Upload Workbook is an Excel Workbook that contains examples
of all of the feeds that are available from Vision.  
It is located in the <i>{fill in the blank}/Samples</i> directory,
and is called <i>VUSample.xls</i>.
<p>
The first Worksheet is the Table Of Contents.  
The TOC identifies all of the feeds on the sheets, and categorizes each feed.  
This is an example of the feeds belonging to the category Company.

<p>
<center>
<img src="workbook1.gif" width=240 height=308 border=1 alt = "Upload Workbook">
</center>
<p>
The button next to each feed name sends you to the worksheet with the
corresponding feed name.
<p>

Each feed that is displayed in the worksheet is there to guide you when
you set up your own feeds.  This is an example of the <i>CompanyMaster</i> feed.
<p> 
<center>
<img src="workbook2.gif" width=437 height=176 border=1 alt = "Company Profile Workbook Sample">
</center>
<p>
You can insert your own data, select the range, and upload it using the technique described above.
<p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="file">Loading Data From A Text File</a></h3>
<p>

Loading data from a text file that is stored in a PC directory should be used when you have a large amount of data to load. 
When the file is loaded this way, <i>VUpload</i> bypasses Excel and loads the data directly into Vision. 
In this example, a <i>CompanyMaster</i> file called <i>comp.txt</i> is located
in the directory <i>c:\datafiles</i>.  To load the text file, do the following:
<p>
1.  Select <i>Upload Data</i> from the <i>VUpload</i> menu.
<p>

2. At the interface, select the class <i>Entity</i> from the <i>Class</i> list box.   
<p>

3. Select <i>CompanyMaster</i> from the <i>Feed</i> list box. 
<p>

4. Select the <i>File</i> button.
<p>
<ul> You should see the <i>Open</i> dialog Box.</ul>
<p>

5. At the <i>Look In</i> text pull down box, find the directory <i>datafiles</i> for the file <i>comp.txt</i>, and select it.  
<p>

<center>
<img src="upload9.gif" width=680 height=419 border=1 alt="Open File Dialog Box">
</center>
<p>

6. Select Open.
<p>
<ul>When the file is loaded, you should see the Diagnostics dialog box.</ul>
<p>

7. Select OK.

<h3><a name="browser">Relationship to the Application Browser</a></h3>
<p>
To use Vision's web-based applications, there needs to be at least
one Vision session running waiting for browser requests.  These Vision
sessions are known as <i>listeners</i>.  Two types of listener can
be started: <i>master listeners</i> and <i>private listeners</i>.
The <a href="pmaDBA.htm#web">Vision Administrator</a>
can start one or more master
listeners which are available and shared by all browser users.
Analysts using the Excel add-ins automatically start a private listener
which enables them to view private data via the standard browser
applications.
<p>
When you start Excel and connect to Vision, a private listener is
automatically started for you.  When you make a Vision request via your
web browser, it will be routed to this private listener.  Any changes
you make to the database via Excel will be reflected in any applications
you run via the web browser.  No one else will see your changes.
When you exit Excel, these temporary modifications will disappear.
If you wish to commit your changes to the database permanently,
you will need to save them into one or more delimited text files and
notify your administrator.

<a name="schema">Creating New Entities, DataRecords, and Relationships</a>
</h3>

<p>
<a name = "entity"><h4>Creating New Entity Classes</h4></a> 
<p>
<a href="clEntity.htm"><i>Entity</i> classes</a>
 are used to organize instances that represent
real-world entities or classifications.  Entities are always
created using a unique identifier.  Each entity is normally
assigned a name.  The <i>VUpload</i> menu provides a choice for
creating new <i>Entity</i> classes.  

For example, the process of creating a new entity class representing
portfolio managers is described below:
<p>
1. Select <i>Create Entity</i> from the <i>VUpload</i> menu.
<p>

<center>
<img src="entity1.gif" width=215 height=264 alt="Create Entity Dialog Box">

<p>

3. Select OK.
<p>

<center>
<img src="entity3.gif" width=358 height=133 alt="MSGBOX Entity Class Manager Created">
</center>
<p>

4. You should see confirmation that the <i>Manager</i> class has been
created and that the <i>ManagerMaster</i> feed class has been
created for uploading manager data.  
<p>
5. Select OK.
<p>
You can now create new instances of <i>Manager</i> using the
<i>ManagerMaster</i> feed in the <i>Entity</i> feed category.

<p>
<h4>Creating Instances For Entity feeds</h4>
<p>

To create instances for the new <i>Manager</i> feed, the minimal headings that
are required are <i>id</i> and <i>name</i>.  
In this example, the instances <i>Man1</i>, <i>Man2</i>, and <i>Man3</i> are defined. 
<p>

<center>
<img src="manager1.gif" width=164 height=111 border=1 alt="selected Manager instances">

4. Select the Range button.
<p>
<ul>
The diagnostics report should confirm that you have successfully loaded the data.
</ul>
<p>

5. Select OK.
<p>

You have now successfully created 3 instances of the class <i>Manager</i>.

<p>
<hr>
<a name = "datarecord"><h4>Creating New DataRecord Classes</h4></a> 
<p>
<a href="appClasses.htm#data"><i>DataRecord</i></a> classes
are used to manage sets of related
information about a specific entity.  These classes provide a way to
organize data about an entity into manageable substructures.
For example, <i>PriceRecord</i> is used to track pricing information
such as high, low, and closing price for a security.
<i>DataRecord</i> instances are normally accessed via a property
defined at the <i>Entity</i> instance with which it is associated.
<p>
The <i>VUpload</i> menu provides a choice for
creating new <i>DataRecord</i> classes and associating them with
an <i>Entity</i> class.  For example, you can create the class 
<i>ModelData</i> to track several model scores about a company
over time using the following procedure:

<p>
1. Select <i>Create DataRecord</i> from the <i>VUpload</i> menu.
<p>

<center>
<img src="datarecord1.gif" width=407 height=264 alt="Create DataRecord Dialog Box">
</center>
<p>

2. Enter <i>ModelData</i> as the new
DataRecord type, select <i>DataRecord</i> from the <i> From</i> List Box,
select <i>Company</i> from the <i>Link To Entity...</i> list box, and enter
<i>modelData</i> in the <i>access via:</i> text box.  Select 
<i>Time Series</i> to indicate that the model data varies over time.
<p>

<center>
<img src="datarecord2.gif" width=407 height=264 alt="Creating ModelData">

<p>

4. You should see confirmation that the <i>ModelData</i> class has been
define and linked to the <i>Company</i> class via the
<i>modelData</i> path.  The <i>ModelDataFeed</i> has been
created for uploading model data for a company over time.
<p>
5. Select OK.
<p>

You have now created the feed name <i>ModelDataFeed</i>, which is
found in the <i>Entity Extender</i> feed category.

<p>
<h4>Creating Properties for a DataRecord</h4>
<p>
Before you can create instances for a DataRecord, you must define properties for it.  
A <i>property</i> is a message that is defined for a specific class. 
When defining a property, you use the feed name <i>PropertySetup</i>.
In this example, <i>ModelData</i> defines properties for the model scores, 
<i>model1</i>, <i>model2</i>, and <i>model3</i>.   
Select the range and upload it.
<p>

<center>
<img src= "modeldata1.gif" width=325 height=153 border=1 alt = "selected range property setup" >
</center>
 
<p>

You will receive notification that the properties for DataRecord have been established.

You can now create new instances of <i>ModelData</i> using the
<i>ModeDataFeed</i> feed in the <i>Entity Extender</i> feed category.


<p>
<h4>Creating DataRecord Instances for Companies Over Time</h4>

<p>

In this example, you are tracking model scores for several companies for several dates:
<p>

1. Select the Range

</ul>
<p>

<center>
<img src= "modeldata3.gif" width=391 height=336 alt = "ModelData displayed in the interface" >
</center>
<p>

4. Select Range.
<p>

The diagnostic report should confirm that you have successfully loaded the data.
See <a href="#extract">The Data Extraction Module</a> for a sample of how to 
extract this data.

<p>
<a name = "relationship"><h4>Creating A Relationship</h4></a> 
<p>
Relationship are used to define <i>MembershipFeeds</i> for
uploading one-to-many relationships such as
<i>company-to-industry</i> over time.
For example, every portfolio is managed by a single manager
at a given point in time and a manager manages zero, one, or many
portfolios at a given point in time.  You can create a relationship
to track this using the following procedure:
<p>

1. Select <i>Create Relationship</i> from the <i>VUpload</i> menu.
<p>

<center>
<img src="relationship1.gif" width=391 height=264 alt="Create Relationship Dialog Box">
</center>
<p>

2. Enter <i>PortToManager</i> as the new
relationship, select <i>Manager</i> from the <i>Group Type</i> list box,
and <i>Portfolio</i> from the <i>Member Type:</i> list box.
You need to define the access path from <i>Portfolio</i> to
<i>Manager</i> and from <i>Manager</i> to <i>Portfolio</i>.
Since each manager tracks a list of portfolios, enter
<i>portfolioList</i> for the <i>GroupType path</i>.  
Since each portfolio is managed by a single manager at a given point
in time, enter <i>manager</i> for the <i>MemberType path</i>.
Select <i>Time Series</i> to indicate that the relationship will
change over time.
<p>

<center>
<img src="relationship2.gif" width=389 height=261 alt="Creating PortToManager Relationship Paths">

<p>


<h4>Creating Instances For Relationships</h4>

<p>
To create relationships, you must have data for <i>memberId</i> and a <i>groupId</i>.  
In this example, the members are instances of <i>Portfolio</i> and the groups
are instances of <i>Manager</i>.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> You need to define instances for PortolioMaster to do this example.
<p>
1. Select The Range.
