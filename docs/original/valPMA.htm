<h3><a name="overview">Overview</a></h3>
<p>
The core Vision system comes with a set of classes already defined.
These classes include an initial set of methods which can be
modified and extended by the user.  Vision's built-in class
hierarchy is discussed in detail in the 
<a href="clXRef.htm">general Vision documentation</a>.
The <b>Portfolio Management Application Layer</b> defines 
classes, protocol, and starter applications that address the
needs of the portfolio management function.
This layer is entirely implemented using the Vision
language and can be readily tailored 
to meet the specific needs of your organization.
<p>
Note that the actual entities created for the core investment classes
will be dependent on your installation's requirements.  Many of the
named entities used in the examples in these documents
are included for illustration
purposes only and may not exist in your environment.
You can create them using the techniques provided or substitute
entity identifiers that are defined for you organization.

<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="install">Installation</a></h3>
<p>
The <i>Vision Run-Time Environment</i> provides the tools needed to
build and maintain a Vision database designed to 
deliver Web-based applications to users via an internal intranet.
Basic capabilities provided in this environment include
a starter suite of web-based applications, initial templates for
loading portfolio, security, and supporting information, and basic tools
for committing data to the database.
<p>
The document, 
<a href="pmaInstall.htm"><i>Portfolio Management Application: Installation
</i></a>
describes the implementation process.

<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="apps">Headstart Applications and Analyst Tools</a></h3>
<p>
The <b>Portfolio Management Application Layer</b> includes a starter
suite of web-based applications.  These applications are accessed with
a web browser via an organization's intranet.
The Headstart applications are described in the document,
<a href="pmaApps.htm"><i>Portfolio Management Application: Headstart Application</i></a>.
<p>
In addition,
analysts can interact with Vision using Excel Add-ins designed to extract
data from Vision and temporarily define and modify data that is
used in conjunction with browser applications.  These analyst tools
are described in the document,
<a href="pmaAnalyst.htm"><i>Portfolio Management Application: Analyst Tools</i></a>.

<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="upload">Uploading Data</a></h3>
<p>
Standardized interfaces for loading data from external sources are
provided as part of this Application Layer.
An <a href="pmaAnalyst.htm">Excel interface is available</a> for making
temporary modifications to the database.  These changes will be
reflected in an analyst's private versions of browser reports,
but will not be saved permanently.  Tools for committing permanent
changes to the database <a href="pmaDBA.htm#data">are also provided</a>.
<p>
The pre-defined data feeds are described in the document,
<a href="pmaFeeds.htm"><i>Portfolio Management Application: Feeds</i></a>.

<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="dbadmin">Database Updates and Administration</a></h3>
<p>
A collection of database administration tools are available for 
loading data into the database, defining additional database 
schema, and performing various database maintenance functions.
<p>
A single user is designated as the Vision database administrator
and is given access to these tools which are described in the document,
<a href="pmaDBA.htm"><i>Portfolio Management Application: Administration</i>
</a>.

<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="start">Getting Started</a></h3>
<p>
Once you have <a href="#install">installed your software</a>,
reviewed the <a href="pmaFeeds.htm"> data feed requirements</a>,
and created an initial set of feeds, you are ready to
start loading and using your data.   Samples of this process
are described in the document,
<a href="pmaStarting.htm">
<i>Portfolio Management Application: Getting Started</i></a>.
<p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="next">Next Steps</a></h3>
<p>
Over time, you will probably want to add new reports and
expand the set of internal and external data feeds you incorporate.
You will be able to do many of these enhancements on your own using
the techniques you learned during the installation process.  
At this point, you may want to learn more about the Vision language
so you can modify and create additional applications.  In addition,
you may want to familiarize yourself with the production tools 
that have been defined to help manage your Vision environment.

<h3><a name="core">Core Classes</a></h3>
<p>
The <b>Portfolio Management Application Layer</b> defines a number of
core classes used to manage investment data.  Core entity classes
include <b>Company</b>, <b>Security</b>, <b>Industry</b>, and <b>Account</b>.
Additional information is managed by subclasses of <b>DataRecord</b>
and <b>LinkRecord</b> including <b>PriceRecord</b>, <b>DivRecord</b>,
and <b>Holding</b>. 
<p>
These classes are described in detail in the document, 
<a href="pmaClasses.htm"><i>Portfolio Management Application: Classes</i></a>.

<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="supp">Supplemental Core Classes</a></h3>
<p>
The <b>Portfolio Management Application Layer</b> defines a number of
supplemental core classes that are available as part of the <i>Headstart
Application Kit</i>.  Supplemental entity classes include
<b>Analyst</b> and <b>Manager</b>.
Additional information is managed by subclasses of <b>DataRecord</b>
including fundamental company data and country economics.
<p>
These classes are described in detail in the document, 
<a href="pmaSupp.htm"><i>Portfolio Management Application: 
Supplemental Classes</i></a>.

<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="issues">Special Issues</a></h3>
<p>
Special structures have been designed to manage holdings, dividend,
price, and adjustment data in the Vision database.
These structures have been created to correctly handle split and
currency adjustments
automatically.  In addition, these structures have been designed
to facilitate future reorganizations as the database grows, so that 
applications that use this data are sheltered from structural changes.
<p>
The document, 
<a href="pmaIssues.htm"><i>Portfolio Management Application: Issues</i></a>
describes these issues in more detail.

<p>
The document, 
<a href="pmaTutor.htm">
<i>Portfolio Management Application: Language Tutorial</i></a>
provides a tutorial for writing basic Vision programs using the
<b>Portfolio Management Application Layer</b> classes and messages.
