Insyte Partners With CA to Deliver Time-Varying Data Management to Jasmine Users
</h2>

<p>
ISLANDIA, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 15, 1998--
Computer Associates International, Inc. (CA) and Innovative
Systems Techniques (Insyte) today announced a development partnership
that gives Jasmine users the ability to manage complex, time-varying
data through the TimeSeries Class Libraries.

<p>
Insyte's TimeSeries Class Libraries, a class family within
Jasmine, provide encapsulated functionality for creating, updating,
retrieving and manipulating data which changes over time, such as
stock prices, from Jasmine or for any Jasmine application. In
addition, this data can be used with any other information in a
Jasmine database to create a new generation of applications.

<p>
``There is a tremendous synergy between Jasmine's focus on
multimedia information and our focus on analytical and time series
data,'' said Richard Newman, executive vice president of Insyte. ``The
integration of the two gives Jasmine developers extraordinary
abilities to mesh sophisticated, time-varying data with multimedia
applications on Internet, intranet, extranet, or standard
client/server environments.''

<p>
A company that follows performance of stock indexes such as the
S&amp;P 500, for example, can track this information over time by storing
it in a TimeSeries object for each date that the index components
change. The TimeSeries class allows the changes in an item to be
monitored between either regular or irregular time intervals, which
provides the flexibility for real-world modeling.

<p>
``Time-varying data is the lifeblood of many businesses, yet
managing this complex information with a relational database is
virtually impossible,'' said Yogesh Gupta, CA senior vice president
of product strategy. ``As a result, data that changes with time has
been left out of many corporate data stores - until now. Insyte and
CA are teaming up to deliver the best solution for companies who rely
on this critical time-varying information.''

<p>
The interactions between the Insyte and Jasmine object-oriented
environments have been encapsulated so that tasks can be automatically
processed within the environment most suited to a specific operation.
TimeSeries intervals can be regular or irregular, providing the
flexibility that real-world modeling demands. Each object in a class
might have different points represented in a time-varying property,
allowing extremely sophisticated tasks to be performed with ease.

<p>
Jasmine is the first pure object solution for building
next-generation business systems over Internet and client/server
computing environments. It offers developers an object-oriented
platform ideally suited for dynamic multimedia applications, while
delivering the integrity and practical data management required for
mainstream business solutions.
