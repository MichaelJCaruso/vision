<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>

The instances of the class Company represent the individual  corporate
entities  for which you track information.  Information maintained for
a company typically includes sales, earnings estimates,  and  ratings.
A large  amount  of raw data about companies is available in external
databases.  In Vision, the data  provided  by  each  external  company
database  is  viewed as a property of the company. In other words, the
company <i>Nestles</i> is a Vision object whose  properties  could  include
<i>IbesData</i> and <i>WorldScopeData</i> in addition to <i>name</i>, <i>industry</i>, and
<i>earnings</i>.
<p>

The  instances  of  the  class  Security  represent   the   individual
securities  issued by a corporation, government, or some other entity.
A variety of security  types  exist  including  common  and  preferred
stocks,  convertible and non-convertible bonds, cash, and put and call
options.  Data maintained for a  security  typically  includes  price,
dividend and shares outstanding information.  Portfolios hold specific
amounts of one or more individual securities.  Some external databases
provide  information about specific securities.  The security <i>Nestles
Common Stock</i> is  a  Vision  object  whose  properties  could  include
<i>MSCIData</i> in addition to <i>name</i>, <i>price</i>, and <i>sharesOut</i>.
<p>

The  security  <i>Nestles  Common  Stock</i>  is  a  Vision  object   whose
properties  include  pricing,  dividend,  and split information.  This
object is distinct from the company <i>Nestles</i> whose properties include
sales,  earnings,  and  industry  information.   Although  Company and
Security are distinct  classes  in  the  Vision  hierarchy,  there  is
obviously  a  close  relationship between related instances of the two
classes since each security is issued by a unique  company  (or  other
issuer).
<p>

When you refer to the price earnings ratio for  a  security,  you  are
really  asking  for  the  current price of the security divided by the
earnings per share for the corporate entity that issued the  security.
The  property  <i>company</i> is defined at Security to return the value of
the  company  associated  with  the  security.   The   actual   object
representing  the  company  is  returned.   For  example,  the  Vision
expression:

<pre>    Named Security GM company</pre>

returns the object representing the company GM and the expression:


<pre>    Named Security GM company = Named Company GM </pre>

yields the result TRUE.  Note that several  securities  may  have  the
same value for company since more than one security can be issued by a
single Company entity.  By default,  the  value  of  <i>company</i>  for  a
security  is  the default company instance. Automated and manual rules
can be used to link a security to its "real" company instance.
<p>

When you refer to the price earnings ratio  for  a  company,  you  are
really  asking for the current price of the company's primary security
divided by the earnings per  share  for  the  company.   The  property
<i>primarySecurity</i>  is  defined  at  Company to return the value of the
security defined as the primary security for the company.  The  actual
object representing the security is returned.  For example, the Vision
expression:

<pre>    Named Company GM primarySecurity </pre>

returns the object representing GM's common  stock  security  and  the
expression:

<pre>    Named Company GM primarySecurity = Named Security GM</pre>

yields the result TRUE.  Note that only one security can  be  assigned
as  the  <i>primarySecurity</i>  for  a  Company.  By default, the value of
<i>primarySecurity</i> for a company  is  the  default  security  instance.
Automated and manual rules can be used to link a company to its <i>real</i>
primary security instance.

<h2 id="TheCompanyClass">The Company Class</h2>
 
The following key properties are defined for the class Company:
<p>

<center><table border=1 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><b>Property</b><td><b>Initial Value</b><td><b>Type</b>
<tr><td>code<td>Supplied String<td>String
<tr><td>name<td>code<td>String
<tr><td>ticker<td>code<td>String
<tr><td>* primarySecurity<td>Named Security Default<td>Security

<tr><td>* fiscalYearEnd<td>12<td>Integer
<tr><td>securityList<td>Empty List<td>List   
</table></center>                
<center>* Included in Company initialization list</center>
<p>
                             
In addition to the standard Entity initializations, the class  Company
performs the following steps when you create a new instance:
<p>

<ul type=disc>
<li>The <i>ticker</i> property is assigned the value of code (i.e., the
value supplied as a parameter to the <i>createInstance:</i> message).
<p>
<li>The <i>fiscalYearEnd</i> property is assigned to the value 12.
<p>
<li>The <i>securityList</i> property is assigned to be an empty list.  By
default, no security instances are associated with this company. 
</ul>

For example, the expression:

<pre>    Company createInstance: "370442". </pre>

creates a new Company instance with a code of <i>370442</i>.  The <i>profile</i>
message can be used to display a summary description of this company:

<pre>    Named Company at: "370442". profile </pre>

produces:

<pre>    *** Company Profile For: 370442
    Code:                         370442
    Aliases:                      370442  

    ---  Links   ---
    primarySecurity :             Default   00000000  Default   Default
    baseCurrency :                Default   Default
    country :                     Default   Default

    fiscalYearEnd:                12 
</b> </pre>
   The message <i>setTickerTo:</i> is used to assign an alternative  value  to
   the <i>ticker</i> property.  This value is automatically added to the alias
   list for the company instance as well.  For example:

<pre>     Named Company at: "370442" .
                setNameTo: "GENERAL MOTORS" .
                setTickerTo: "GM" ;
     Named Company GM profile ;  
</pre>

produces:

<pre>    *** Company Profile For: GENERAL MOTORS
    Code:                         370442
    Aliases:                      370442 / GM /

    ---  Links   ---
    primarySecurity :             Default   00000000  Default   Default
    baseCurrency :                Default   Default
    country :                     Default   Default

    ticker:                       GM
    fiscalYearEnd:                12 
</pre>

Notice that messages  such  as  <i>baseCurrency</i>  and  <i>primarySecurity</i>
return   an  object  of  another  entity  class.   As  a  result,  the
expression:

<pre>    Named Company GM baseCurrency name </pre>

returns the name associated  with  the  company  GM's  currency.   The
expression:

<pre>    Named Company GM primarySecurity price </pre>

returns the price associated with GM's primary security.
<p>

The <i>primarySecurity</i> for a company is initially set  to  the  Default
security  instance.   The message: <i>setPrimarySecurityTo:</i> can be used
to assign a different security as the default.  You can use  a  string
that is a valid alias for the security or an actual security instance
as the parameter.  For example, if a  security  named  <i>GM</i>  has  been
defined, the expressions:

<pre>    Named Company GM setPrimarySecurityTo: Named Security GM  .</pre>
or
<pre>    Named Company GM setPrimarySecurityTo: "GM"  . </pre>

can be used to assign the value of the <i>primarySecurity</i> property.  If
the supplied parameter does not refer to a valid security, the value of
<i>primarySecurity</i> will not  be  changed.   If  the  supplied  security
refers  to  a  company other than this instance, the reassignment will
also not be executed.  If the security currently refers to the default
company, its company will automatically be reassigned to refer to this
instance.  Since this method is often used as part of a <i>bulk</i> update,
no  error  messages  are  displayed  when  the  primarySecurity is not
reassigned.
<p>

<hr>

<h2 id="OtherCompanyMessages">Other Company Messages</h2>

When you change the <i>name</i>, <i>ticker</i> or  <i>primarySecurity</i>  properties
for  a  company,  you  should use one of the messages described in the
previous section.  The message <i>setFiscalYearEndTo:</i> should be used to
change  the  value of <i>fiscalYearEnd</i> for a company.  This method only
changes the value if the supplied parameter is a number between 1  and
12.  For example:

<pre>    Named Company GM setFiscalYearEndTo: 12 ; </b> </pre>

Note that companies are automatically created with  a  default  fiscal
year end value of 12.
<p>

The property <i>securityList</i> has been defined to return the list of
securities associated with the company.  This list is initially empty.
The message  <i>rebuildSecurityList</i> can  be  executed  to  update  the
<i>securityList</i>  property  for  all  companies. This method is normally
executed as part of the production update cycle; however, you can  use
it during your session if you have manually redefined the relationship
between any security and company instances.
<p>

The following section summarizes additional messages defined  for  the
Company  class  and  links to  where  they  are  described in further
detail:

<p>               

The remaining properties can be changed using the standard  assignment
operation.  For example, the expression:

<pre>    Named Company GM :country <- Named Country US ; </pre>

assigns the Country instance representing the United  States  to  GM's
country property.

<h2 id="TheSecurityClass">The Security Class</h2>

The following key properties are defined for the class Security:
<p>

<center><table border=1 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><b>Property</b><td><b>Initial Value</b><td><b>Type</b>
<tr><td>code<td>Supplied String<td>String
<tr><td>name<td>code<td>String

<tr><td>adjustmentFactor<td>1.0<td>Number
<tr><td>unitCalc<td>1.0<td>Number
</table></center>
<center>* Included in Security initialization list</center>
<p>

In addition to the standard Entity initializations, the class Security
performs the following steps when you create a new instance:
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>The <i>ticker</i> property is assigned the value of code (i.e., the
value supplied as a parameter to the <i>createInstance:</i> message).
<p>
<li>The structures needed to support pricing, dividend, and holdings access are initialized.
<p>
<li>The <i>adjustmentFactor</i> and <i>unitCalc</i> values are initialized to 1. 
</ul>

For example, the expression:

<pre>    Security createInstance: "37044210" . </pre>

creates a new Security  instance  with  a  code  of  <i>37044210</i>.   The
<i>profile</i> message can be used to display a summary description of this
security:

<pre>    Named Security at: "37044210" . profile </pre>

produces:

<pre>    *** Security Profile For: 37044210
    Code:                         37044210

    holdings (count):                     0 
</pre>

The message <i>setTickerTo:</i> is used to assign an alternative  value  to
the  <i>ticker</i>  property.   This  value  is  automatically added to the
<i>aliases</i> property for the security instance as well. For example:

<pre>    Named Security at: "37044210" .
       setNameTo: "GENERAL MOTORS COM" .
       setTickerTo: "GM" ;
    Named Security GM profile ;
</pre>

produces:

<pre>    *** Security Profile For: GENERAL MOTORS COM
    Code:                         37044210
    Aliases:                      37044210 / GM /

    company :                     Default   Default   Default
    baseCurrency :                Default   Default
    type :                        Default   Default

    canCusip:                          NA
    cusip:                             NA
    sedol:                             NA
    . . .
</pre>

The properties <i>cusip</i>, <i>canCusip</i>, and <i>sedol</i> have been  defined  to
allow  you  alternative  means for identifying a security.  A specific
security will set the value of  one  of  these  properties  using  the
message   <i>setCusipTo:</i>,   <i>setCanCusipTo:</i>,  or  <i>setSedolTo:</i>.   For
example:

<pre>    Named Security GM
          setCusipTo: "37044210" .
    do: [ "Cusip: " print: 20 ; cusip printNL ;
          "Can Cusip: " print: 20 ; canCusip printNL ;
          "Sedol: " print: 20 ; sedol printNL ;
        ] ;
</pre>

produces:

<pre>    Cusip:              37044210
    Can Cusip:                 NA
    Sedol:                     NA
</pre>

The <i>cusip</i> or <i>sedol</i> value is automatically added to  the  <i>aliases</i>
property  for the security instance.  Because there are many different
potential sources for a security identifier, conflicts  are  possible.
For  example,  a  US  and  a Canadian security may have the same cusip
number.  Only one of these can be returned using the  <i>Named  Security
cusipId</i> expression.  You can set up additional XRef dictionaries to track additional identifiers.
<p>

The <i>company</i> for a security is initially set to the  Default  company
instance.   The  message:  <i>setCompanyTo:</i>  can  be  used  to assign a
different company.  You can use a string that is a valid alias for the
company  or an actual company instance as the parameter.  For example,
the expressions:

<pre>    Named Security GM setCompanyTo: Named Company GM </pre>
or
<pre>    Named Security GM setCompanyTo: "GM"</pre>

can be used to assign the value of the  <i>company</i>  property.   If  the
supplied  parameter  does  not  refer  to a valid company the value of
<i>company</i> will not be changed. Since this method is often used as part
of  a  "bulk" update, no error messages are displayed when the company
is not reassigned.

The  following  section summarizes  additional  messages  defined  for  the Security class and
indicates where they are described in further detail, if appropriate:
<p>

</table border></center>
<p>

<p>

The <i>_eps</i>, <i>_sharesOut</i>, and pricing data are usually updated as part
of  an  external  pricing feed.  These values are all stored over time
and are updated using the <i>asOf:put:</i>  message.   Split  and  currency
adjustment  issues are described more fully in the <a href="invIssues.htm">
Investment Issues</a> document.  The  <i>type</i>  and  <i>unitCalc</i>  properties  are
maintained  as  part  of  the external pricing update or as part of an
internal security <i>refresh</i> feed.  These values can be  changed  using
the standard assignment operation.  For example, the expression:

<pre>    Named Security GM :_sharesOut asOf: 9311 put: 1234000 ;</pre>

assigns the value 1234000 as  GM's  shares  outstanding  value  as  of
November 1993 and the expression:

<pre>    Named Security GM :unitCalc <- 1.0 ; </pre>

assigns the values 1 to the <i>unitCalc</i> property.

Company and Security instances are usually created and  maintained  as
part  of  a  nightly  production cycle.  The specific processing rules
used vary based  on  your  installation's  policies.   
<p>

Your installation may have defined many additional  messages  for  the
Company  and  Security  classes.  The <i>showMessages</i> message is the
fastest way to determine the current list of messages available for  a
class.  For example:
<pre>    Company showMessages </pre>

External databases such as WorldScope  and  Ibes  provide  data  about
specific  entities.  Each  database  includes one or more classes that
track different information about a company (or security)  over  time.
Access  to this data is provided via a set of messages defined to link
a specific company or security instance with its corresponding data in
the  external  source.   External  databases  are updated as part of a
regular production cycle.  Access to external databases  is  described
in detail in <a href="invExtDB.htm">External Database Access</a> of this document.
