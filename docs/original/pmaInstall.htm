<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
The Vision <b>Portfolio Management Application Layer</b> provides
an initial set of application and data feed templates that support
the needs of the portfolio management function.  These templates provide
a good starting point for all installations.  Because of varying 
application, data, and support requirements, the basic product is
normally tailored to meet the specific needs of your organization.
Insyte works with you to implement these customizations and to
develop an on-going production process that suits your environment.
<p>
A successful implementation requires several key ingredients:
<p><ul type=disc>
<li>small initial group of end users who are eager for information and want
a role in tailoring the initial applications
<li>strong individual to liaison between users and IT
<li>IT support
</ul>
<p>
Once the software has been installed,
Insyte recommends a three month phased implementation process to
tailor the product to reflect the specific requirements of your organization.  
In addition to introducing end-users
to the capabilities, a key objective during this period is to get
the internal group supporting the product acclimated with the software,  
data integration, and maintenance issues.  Because this installation methodology
involves end users, IT, and support personnel, it encourages
basic knowledge transfer as part of the implementation, which
plays a big role in creating a successful environment.
<p>
<h2 id="runtime">The Vision Run-Time Environment</h2>
<p>
The <i>Vision Run-Time Environment</i> provides the tools needed to
build and maintain a Vision database designed to 
deliver Web-based applications to users via an internal intranet.
Basic capabilities provided in this environment include:
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Starter Suite of Web-based Applications
<li>Initial Data Feed Templates
<li>Analyst tools for making temporary modifications to the database
<li>Administrator tools for committing permanent changes to the database
</ul>
<p>
This environment addresses the needs of many organizations.
Additional capabilities are provided via the <i>Vision Development
Environment</i>, which offers language access, production scheduling
and other facilities that are useful as your Vision usage expands.  
<p>
The <i>Vision Run-Time Environment</i>
is designed to support three classes of user:
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Browser
<li>Analyst
<li>Administrator
</ul>
<p>
A <i>Browser</i> uses a web browser to run applications
via an organization's intranet.  In addition to the
browsing capabilities, an <i>Analyst</i> can
generate temporary modifications to the database.  These modifications
will be reflected in the analyst's private versions of browser reports,
although they will not be saved permanently.  An <i>Administrator</i>
has the ability to commit permanent changes to the database including
data modifications and database extensions that are seen by all users.

<p>
<h2 id="methodology">Tailoring the Product</h2>
<p>
Once your software has been installed, you are ready to start
loading your portfolio data and viewing reports via
your intranet browser.  Placing the proper emphasis on end user involvement,
data feed design, and on-going 
data management issues during the implementation process
helps to ensure a successful rollout.
<p>
We recommend the following three month installation methodology:
<p>
<b>Month 1: <i>Getting Started with Internal Data</i></b>
<p>
The major objective in the first month is to define and load a subset
of your internal data so that portfolio managers can view their own
portfolios via their browser.  This month includes defining the
process for extracting the basic data sets from internal systems
and manually loading the data into your Vision environment.  The
initial data sets should include security, portfolio, and company
masters, holdings data, and supplemental data such as industry and
sector.  The recommended starter feeds are
<a href="#feeds">described in detail below</a>.  These feeds
provide enough information to use most of the starter portfolio reports
without modification.  
<p>
<b>Month 2: <i>Basic Report Customizations and Additional Data</i></b>
<p>
The major objective in the second month is to incorporate links to some
external data feeds, tailor existing applications to meet your
needs, and introduce one or two custom reports.  By
the end of this month, we should have a complete functional system
that includes all the initial data feeds and applications you require
for rollout.
<p>
<b>Month 3: <i>Productionization</i></b>
<p>
The major objective in the third month is to productionize the data
upload process, address cusip/sedol change and split adjustment issues,
and define exception reporting and data error resolution strategies.
Part of this month is used to define a process that best fits into your
organization's current operating environment.
By the end of this month, we should have procedures in place that
enable you to manage the day-to-day operation of your Vision system.

<p>
<h2 id="nextsteps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>
Congratulations, you now have a system in production and many happy
users.  Over time, you will probably want to add new reports and
expand the set of internal and external data feeds you incorporate.
You will be able to do many of these enhancements on your own using
the techniques you learned during the installation process.  Insyte's
consultants are available to design, develop, and install
additional applications
with you.  At this point you may choose to begin learning the Vision
language so that you can develop new reports and applications on your
own.  General Vision language training is available if and when you
decide to embark on this path.

<p>
<h2 id="feeds">Starter Feeds</h2>
<p>

To initialize your Vision database, you will minimally want to supply
the following feeds:
<p>
  <center>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2>
	<tr>
	  <th>Feed<th>Recommended Fields
	</tr>
      <tr>
	<td><a href="pma_CompanyMaster.htm"><b>CompanyMaster</b></a>
	<td><i>entityId</i>, <i>name</i>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td><a href="pma_SecurityMaster.htm"><b>SecurityMaster</b></a>
	<td><i>entityId</i>, <i>name</i>, <i>ticker</i>, <i>companyId</i>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td><a href="pma_PortfolioMaster.htm"><b>PortfolioMaster</b></a>
	<td><i>entityId</i>, <i>name</i>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td><a href="pma_HoldingsFeed.htm"><b>HoldingsFeed</b></a>
	<td><i>acctId</i>, <i>secId</i>, <i>date</i>, <i>shares</i>, <i>mval</i>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>
<p>
You should supply one or more tab-delimited files for each of these feeds.
<p>
<b>Hints:</b>
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Any security referenced in your <b>HoldingsFeed</b> should be included
in your <b>SecurityMaster</b>.  Any number of additional securities can
be included.
<p>
<li>If you do not have a <b>CompanyMaster</b>, use your <b>SecurityMaster</b>
for both feeds.
</ul>

<h3 id="Consideration_Multiple_Asset_Types">Consideration: Multiple Asset Types</h3>
<p>
<b>Question:</b>
<ul>
What types of assets are included in your <b>HoldingsFeed</b>?:
</ul>
<p>
<b>Answer: </b>
<i>Only equity holdings are included (i.e., no cash or other asset types)</i>
<ul>
You are all set.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Answer: </b>
<i>Holdings include equity plus cash</i>
<ul>
You have several options:
<p><ul type=disc>
<li>use the string <i>CashUS</i> as the value of <i>secId</i> in the
<b>HoldingsFeed</b> to indicate a cash holding.
<li>identify aliases that are used to indicate a cash holding in the
<b>HoldingsFeed</b> and add them to the <i>CashUS</i> security using
the <a href="pma_SecurityAliases.htm"><b>SecurityAliases</b></a> feed.
<li>use general multiple asset type rules, described below.
</ul></ul>
<p>
<b>Answer: </b>
<i>Holdings potentially include multiple asset types</i>
<ul>
You need to add a security type indicator for the securities in your 
master.  You should:
<p><ul type=disc>
<li>supply the
<a href="pma_SecurityTypeMaster.htm"><b>SecurityTypeMaster</b></a>
feed with the fields <i>entityId</i>, <i>name</i>, and <i>assetCategory</i>.
<li>add the field <i>type</i> to your <b>SecurityMaster</b> with values that
correspond to the security types you have defined.
</ul>
<p>
