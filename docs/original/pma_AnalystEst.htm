<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>
<ul>
The <i>AnalystEst</i> feed is used to create and update 
   <b>AnalystEstimate</b> data record instances for companies.  
   A separate <b>AnalystEstimate</b> record is created for each
   date for which data is available for a company.
   The data is accessed via the time series property <i>analystEsts</i>
   defined for the <b>Company</b> class.
<p>
   This feed can include data for any number
   of companies for any number of dates and 
   can be used to initialize new dates, set initial values for 
   properties and/or change existing values.
<p>
   This class is described in the
   <a href="pmaSupp.htm#Analyst"><i>Portfolio Management Application
   Supplemental Classes</i></a> document.  
<p>
</ul>

<h3>Special Processing Rules:</h3>
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>The <i>entityId</i> must correspond to an existing <b>Company</b>
     instance.  Any valid company alias can be used to identify the company.
<p>
<li>The <i>date</i> must be included and indicates the 
      date of the data.  It can be in any valid date format
      such as <i>9705</i> or <i>5/31/97</i>.  This date is used to update
      the <b>Company</b> time series property <i>analystEsts</i>.
<p>
<li>If the <i>entityId</i> and <i>date</i> are valid and the date does
      not currently exist in the <b>Company</b> time series property 
      <i>analystEsts</i>, a new <b>AnalystEstimate</b> instance is 
      created and added to this time series on this date.  Any items
      supplied by this feed are then set or refreshed.  Note that you
      do not need to include all the items in a single feed.
<p>
<li>The <i>currencyId</i> is used to identify the currency in which the
      data values are supplied.
      This currency can be different from the company's base currency.  
      By default, the information is
      automatically converted into its company's base currency when it
      is accessed (in cases where the currencies are different).
      If the supplied <i>currencyId</i> 
      does not map to an existing currency instance, the record's
      <i>baseCurrency</i> is set to the default currency.
<p>
<li>The <i>adjustmentDate</i> is used to identify the date through
      which the data in the feed instance has been adjusted for splits.
      Normally, this date is the same as the record's date and this field
      need not be provided.  When loading history and/or corrections,
      the values may be supplied unadjusted (i.e., the values that
      existed on the date) or adjusted (i.e., the values adjusted for
      any splits that have occurred since the date.  If the data is
      unadjusted, the <i>adjustmentDate</i> field is not needed or can 
      contain the same value as the <i>date</i> field.  If the
      data has been adjusted to reflect splits that have occurred since
      the record date, this field should indicate the date through
      which splits have been applied.
<p>
      Note that you do not need to resend data that has changed as the result
      of a split adjustment.  Only true data corrections need to be supplied 
     using this feed.
<p>
<li>The <i>nextYearEnd</i> date field is used to specify the next fiscal
      year end date for which estimates can be provided.  This date will
      be a future date for companies that have reported the year-end data
      and will be a prior date for companies that have not yet reported.
      For example, if a company's fiscal year ends in December and it 
      currently January 1998, the company will not have reported its
      December 1997 data.  The next year end in this case would be
      12/31/97.  Once the company has reported its 1997 data, the next
      year end should be set to 12/31/98.  The <i>y1Est</i>, <i>y2Est</i>,
      and <i>y3Est</i> values correspond to the annual estimates for the
      next three fiscal year ends.
<p>
<li>The <i>nextQuarterEnd</i> date field is used to specify the next fiscal
      quarter end date for which estimates can be provided.  This date will
      be a future date for companies that have reported their latest
      quarter-end data
      and will be a prior date for companies that have not yet reported.
      For example, if a company's fiscal quarter ends in December and it 
      currently January 1998, the company will not have reported its
      December 1997 data.  The next quarter end in this case would be
      12/31/97.  Once the company has reported its 12/97 data, the next
      quarter end should be set to 3/31/98.  The <i>q1Est</i>, <i>q2Est</i>,
      <i>q3Est</i>, and <i>q4Est</i> values correspond to the quarterly
      estimates for the next four fiscal quarter ends.
