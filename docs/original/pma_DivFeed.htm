<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>
<ul>
The <i>DivFeed</i> feed is used to create and update <b>DivRecord</b>
   instances for securities.  This feed can include data for any number
   of securities for any number of dates.  This class is used to track
   cash dividends paid by a security over time.  The <b>DivRecord</b> class is
   described in detail in the 
   <a href="pmaIssues.htm#prices"><i>Portfolio Management Application
     Issues</i></a> document.  
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Special Processing Rules:</h3>
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>The <i>entityId</i> must correspond to an existing <b>Security</b>
     instance.  Any valid security alias can be used to identify the security.
<p>
<li>The <i>date</i> must be included and indicates the ex-date of the
      dividend.  It can be in any valid date format
      such as <i>19971215</i> or <i>12/15/97</i>.
<p>
<li>The <i>currencyId</i> is used to identify the currency in which the
      dividend is supplied.
      This currency can be different from the security's base currency.  
      By default, the dividend information is
      automatically converted into its security's base currency when it
      is accessed (in cases where the currencies are different).
      If the supplied <i>currencyId</i> 
      does not map to an existing currency instance, the dividend record's
      <i>baseCurrency</i> is set to the default currency.
<p>
<li>The <i>adjustmentDate</i> is used to identify the date through
      which the data in the feed instance has been adjusted for splits.
      Normally, this date is the same as the record's date and this field
      need not be provided.  When loading dividend history and/or corrections,
      the values may be supplied unadjusted (i.e., the values that
      existed on the ex-date) or adjusted (i.e., the values adjusted for
      any splits that have occurred since the ex-date.  If the data is
      unadjusted, the <i>adjustmentDate</i> field is not needed or can 
      contain the same value as the <i>date</i> field.  If the
      data has been adjusted to reflect splits that have occurred since
      the record date, this field should indicate the date through
      which splits have been applied.
<p>
      Note that you do not need to resend data that has changed as the result
      of a split adjustment.  Only true data corrections need to be supplied 
      using this feed.
<p>
<li>The <i>recordValue</i> field should contain the total cash dividends
      paid by that security on that date.  
</ul>
