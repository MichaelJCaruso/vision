<H3>Special Processing Rules:</H3>
<P>
<UL type=disc>
  <LI>The <I>entityId</I> must correspond to an existing <B>Security</B> 
  instance. Any valid security alias can be used to identify the security. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>The <I>date</I> must be included and indicates the date for which the 
  price information applies. It can be in any valid date format such as 
  <I>19971215</I> or <I>12/15/97</I>. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>The <I>currencyId</I> is used to identify the currency in which the 
  <I>close</I>, <I>high</I>, and <I>low</I> information are supplied. This 
  currency can be different from the security's base currency. By default, the 
  pricing information is automatically converted into its security's base 
  currency when it is accessed (in cases where the currencies are different). If 
  the supplied <I>currencyId</I> does not map to an existing currency instance, 
  the price record's <I>baseCurrency</I> is set to the default currency. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>The <I>adjustmentDate</I> is used to identify the date through which the 
  data in the feed instance has been adjusted for splits. Normally, this date is 
  the same as the record's date and this field need not be provided. When 
  loading price history and/or corrections, the pricing values may be supplied 
  unadjusted (i.e., the values that existed on the price date) or adjusted 
  (i.e., the values adjusted for any splits that have occurred since the price 
  date). If the data is unadjusted, the <I>adjustmentDate</I> field is not 
  needed or can contain the same value as the <I>date</I> field. If the data has 
  been adjusted to reflect splits that have occurred since the record date, this 
  field should indicate the date through which splits have been applied. 
  <P>Note that you do not need to resend data that has changed as the result of 
  a split adjustment. Only true data corrections need to be supplied using this 
  feed. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Any non-numeric value supplied for the <I>close</I>, <I>high</I>, 
  <I>low</I>, and <I>volume</I> fields, and numeric values less than or equal to 
  0 are stored as <I>NA</I> (not available). 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Any non-numeric value supplied for <I>yield</I> and numeric values less 
  than 0 are stored as NA (not available). 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Only one of <I>dailyReturn</I> or <I>unitReturn</I> needs to be included 
  since either value can be derived from the other.
  <P></P><LI>Due to the specialized nature of the PriceFeed, you cannot add new properties through the DataFeed mechanism.  Contact your Vision Consultant for any customization requirements.</li>

<P>The following tab-delimited feed could be used to update a week's worth of 
closing price and volume data. This format assumes that the data has not been 
adjusted for splits (i.e., the values are the values that were in effect on the 
price date):<PRE><TT><B>

</B></TT></PRE>The following tab-delimited feed could be used to correct data 
for a prior date. This feed corrects the 11/17 price which should have been 
88.50. It assumes a 2-1 split has occurred and presents the correction adjusted 
for this split:<PRE><TT><B>
   Interface ExternalFeedManager upload: "priceFeed" using:
   "entityId date        currencyId   adjustmentDate   close      volume
   12345610  19971117    USD          1/15/98          44.25      .56
    "  ;

</B></TT></PRE>The adjustment date of 1/15/98 indicates that all splits that 
have occurred between 11/17/97 and 1/15/98 have been factored into the 
<I>close</I> and <I>volume</I> values.
