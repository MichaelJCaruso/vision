<h3><a name="overview">Overview</a></h3>
<p>
The core Vision system comes with a set of classes already defined.
These classes include an initial set of methods which can be
modified and extended by the user.  Vision's built-in class
hierarchy is discussed in detail in the 
<a href="clXRef.htm">general Vision documentation</a>.
The <b>Portfolio Management Application Layer</b> defines 
classes, protocol, and starter applications that address the
needs of the portfolio management function.
This layer is entirely implemented using the Vision
language.  You can therefore modify, extend, and reorganize the
structures to meet the specific needs of your organization.
<p>
The <b>Portfolio Management Application Layer</b> includes the
following classes:

<p>
A number of <a href="pmaSupp.htm">optional classes</a>
are provided as part of the
<b>Portfolio Management Application Layer</b>.  These classes
can be installed as is or modified as needed, depending on your
requirements.  Many of the <i>Headstart Applications</i> use
data defined for these classes.  Optional classes include:

<h3><a href="clpmaCompany.htm" name="company">The Company Class</a></h3>
<p>
The instances of the class <b>Company</b> represent the individual 
corporate entities for which you track information.  Information
maintained for a company typically includes country, industry, and
fundamental data such as sales and earnings.  
<p>
The document, 
<a href="clpmaCompany.htm"><i>The Company and Security Classes</i></a>, 
describes the class <b>Company</b> and related classes.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a href="clpmaCompany.htm" name="security">The Security Class</a></h3>
<p>
The instances of the class <b>Security</b> represent the individual 
securities issued by a corporation, government, or other entity.
A variety of security types exist including common and preferred
stock, convertible and non-convertible bonds, and options.  
A company may issue one or more securities.  A security is associated
with no more than one company.  Data 
maintained for a security typically includes price, dividend, and
shares or amount outstanding information.  Accounts hold specific amounts of
one or more individual securities.  
<p>
The document, 
<a href="clpmaCompany.htm"><i>The Company and Security Classes</i></a>,

<h3><a href="clpmaCompany.htm#datarec" name="datarec">
The PriceRecord and DivRecord Classes</a></h3>
<p>
The classes <b>PriceRecord</b> and <b>DivRecord</b> are used to store
pricing and dividend information over time.  Price and dividend records
are normally accessed via messages defined at <b>Security</b>.
Data maintained in a price record includes the trading volume and
the high, low, and closing prices.  Data maintained in a dividend
record includes the dividend amount and the payment date.
<p>
The document, 
<a href="clpmaCompany.htm"><i>The Company and Security Classes</i></a>,

<h3><a href="clpmaAccount.htm" name="account">The Account Class</a></h3>
<p>
The class <b>Account</b> is a super class of the classes
<b>Portfolio</b>, <b>AggAccount</b>, <b>IndexAccount</b>,
and <b>CompositeAccount</b>.
A <b>Portfolio</b> is defined as an account whose holdings are created
via a feed from an internal portfolio accounting system.  An 
<b>AggAccount</b> is
defined as an account whose holdings are created by combining the holdings 
for a list of component portfolios.  An <b>IndexAccount</b> is defined as an
account whose holdings are created starting with a universe of securities.
A <b>CompositeAccount</b> is defined as an account whose holdings are
created as a weighted combination of other accounts.
<p>

<h3><a href="clpmaAccount.htm#holding" name="holding">The Holding Class</a></h3>
<p>
The class <b>Holding</b> is used to represent a specific security held in
an account as of a specific point in time.  
Holdings are rarely referenced directly.  Instead they are accessed
via a particular security or account.  Data maintained for a holding
typically includes shares held and total market value.
<p>
The document, <a href="clpmaAccount.htm"><i>The Account Classes</i></a>, 
describes the <b>Holding</b> class.

<h3><a href= "appClasses.htm" name="core">General Application Classes</a></h3>
<p>
All Vision installations include a basic hierarchy of classes defined
for organizing application classes.  These abstract classes include:
<p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Entity
<li>DataRecord
<li>LinkRecord
<li>Bridge
<li>DataFeed
<li>DBEntity
</ul>
<p>
Most applications will interact with the database via <b>Entity</b>
instances.  The other classes are used to store data or manage navigations
from an entity to other parts of the database.  General application
classes are described in more detail in the document
<a href="appClasses.htm"><i>Core Application Classes</i></a>.
<p>
The classes <a href="clClassify.htm"><b>Classification</b></a>,
<a href="clCurrency.htm"><b>Currency</b></a>
and <a href="clUniverse.htm"><b>Universe</b></a>
are <b>Entity</b> subclasses that are useful in a wide range of applications.
These classes are included as a standard component of all Vision databases.
