<h3>Who We Are</h3>

Insyte, founded in 1981, designs and installs database management and decision support systems using Vision<sup>TM</sup>, our
object-oriented, analytical database management technology.  
As both a technology developer and a systems implementer, we uniquely offer clients access to our Vision technology and the 
direct involvent of our highly capable staff.  
We have installed mission critical, production systems for clients in such industries as investment management, international trade,
health care and media research.

<h3>A Market Hungry for Solutions</h3>

<i>Unlimited Data</i>.  Today's businesses are swimming in data.  
Market data.  Product data.  Competitive data.  Customer data.  
Name it, and businesses have it somewhere in their internal databases, or they can get it from an external data supplier.
<p>

Data is what businesses have been demanding for years in order to do better analysis, make better decisions, and be more competitive.  
However, now that they have succeeded in collecting unlimited amounts of data, they have yet to get from their database vendors the 
software tools they need to really probe the data and unlock the useful information in it all.
<p>

<i>Working on Solutions</i>.  That is not to say that major database developers are not working on solutions.  
Developers recognize there is a huge market waiting for them if they can address this pressing, unmet need for effective and useable information analysis systems.

Most developers are investing millions of dollars to create technologies for analyzing, warehousing, and manipulating data.  
Some of the approaches they are exploring include:
<p>

<ul type=disc>
<li>Relational or object-oriented add-ons to their widely-used relational databases
<li>Storing relational data by column rather than row
<li>OLAPs
<li>New object-relational databases
<li>New object-oriented databases
</ul>

None of these technologies can solve the information analysis problem completely.  But what if the right technology already existed?  What if it already had been proven in large-scale production systems?
<p>

<h3>The Right Technology</h3>

The right technology does exist.  And for over ten years, it has proven itself every day in critical production systems.  
The right technology is Vision<sup>TM</sup> -- our object-oriented, analytical database management system.
<p>

<h3>Vision</h3>

<i>Solving Analytical Problems</i>.  When we founded Insyte back in 1981, we were convinced we could apply database technology to solve clients' analytical problems.  
We developed Vision to enable us to build powerful, flexible, and useable information analysis systems for our clients, something no existing database technology was able to do.
<p>

<i>A Union of Information Models</i>.  Our development team synthesized their many years of experience into Vision, producing a robust and elegant analytical database management technology.  
Vision is object-oriented, yet its heritage originates from database management theory and practice.  
This union of two distinct and effective information models gives Vision unmatched capabilities in storing, manipulating, and analyzing large, complex, time-sensitive databases.
<p>

<i>Vision's Core.</i>  At Vision's core is a scaleable, distributed database management engine designed to support:

<ul type=disc>
<li>Complex analytical queries
<li>Time
<li>Versions
<li>Long transactions
</ul>

An object-oriented programming language is built into the database engine, providing a single, integrated environment for defining, storing, and analyzing data.  
Vision is fully extensible by its users.
<p>

By integrating data and programs into one environment, Vision offers users unparalleled analytical power and real-world modeling capabilities, complementing the data collection 
and transactions processing capabilities of relational databases and greatly surpassing the analytical capabilities of OLAPs and other add-ons.
<p>

<h3>Successful In Production</h3>

<i>A Proven Technology</i>.  We installed our first Vision system for a pioneering client over ten years ago.  
Beginning with that successful first system (a system, we might add, that remains in production today) and continuing with the many successes we have had over the years, the results have been exhilarating.  
Vision unequivocally is a proven technology, running in production in large, multi-user systems at all of our clients.
<p>

<i>A Dynamic Technology</i>.  We have enhanced and broadened Vision over the years to fully exploit and support the breakneck changes occurring in hardware, software, operating systems, networks, intranets, and the internet.  
For example, Vision is fully web-enabled and is running as the analytical information server in corporate intranet applications.  
Vision is an extraordinarily dynamic technology which has evolved in advance of market changes.
<p>

<i>Compatible with Legacy Technologies</i>.  Every one of our Vision production systems interfaces with clients' legacy technologies, including transactions processing systems, trading systems, accounting systems, and data collection processes.  
Vision routinely integrates and analyzes data from clients' own internal systems, from external sources, and from every major relational database our clients use. 
<p>

<h3>Our Clients and Partners</h3>

<i>Clients</i>.  Our clients, who are unabashedly passionate about Vision, represent some of the largest and most distinguished companies in their industries.  
These companies include:

<ul type=disc>
</ul>



In some cases, we developed Vision systems for just a few users within a client company, only to see those systems evolve into corporate-wide production engines used by many -- sometimes hundreds -- of people.  
For all our users, Vision has become integral and indispensable to how they operate day-to-day.
<p>

<i>Partners</i>.  Like our customers, our partners are extremely enthusiastic about Vision.  
We work hand-in-hand with them and consider them to be valued clients.  
Some of our partners are third-party systems developers who are using Vision to build solutions directly for their customers.
<p>

Other partners represent some of the largest and most 
prominent software developers in the industry, with whom 
we are collaborating to integrate Vision's analytical and 
time-series capabilities into their relational and object-oriented database technologies.
<p>

<h3>Where We Are Today</h3>

We are an established, rapidly-growing company.  
We have built a growing business over the years by solving the kinds of complex, time-sensitive information problems for clients that other technology providers and systems developers could not handle.
<p>

We have an exciting technology that a huge market needs.  
In today's extremely competitive business climate, managers increasingly must:

<ul type=disc>
<li>Model their marketplace
<li>Ask and answer ad hoc "what about?" questions
<li>Perform in-depth analysis of their options on a routine, production basis
<li>Manipulate data interactively on their desktop
</ul>

Vision is doing all of this -- and more -- for users today.  
No other technology can match Vision's capabilities and success as an analytical database management system.
<p>

We have a technology that leverages what others are building.  
Major database developers are enthusiastic about the possibilities of analytical database management systems.  
Many are exploring options in object-orientation as a potential approach.  
We already have a powerful object-oriented, analytical database management system that works in the real world and that fully complements the new technologies of major database developers.
<p>

<h3>A Solution for Today -- and Tomorrow</h3>

<i>Years to a Solution?</i>  
The market for analytical information systems is huge, and it is desperate for solutions.  
Database users and developers alike are investing substantial resources to create new analytical applications and technologies.  
As is the case with many new applications and technologies, however, it may take years to make them useable and effective.
<p>

<i>Or Sooner?</i>  With our experienced staff at Insyte, and with our proven Vision technology, useable and effective solutions can happen much sooner.  
Vision complements the new applications and technologies database users and developers are working on.  
It can be integrated with these new solutions to add capabilities that otherwise would be extremely difficult and resource-intensive to build.
