added the below message to clDataFeed
<p>The message <i>enableOnlyUpdateOnChange</i> allows you to update time series properties in an Entity Extender Feed only if the value has changed.  This works with Entity Extender Feeds that are used to update fields that are time series properties, not feeds that update time series of records. You can set the switches <i>enableOnlyUpdateOnChange</i> and <i>disableOnlyUpdateOnChange</i> to control the behavior of the next update for the feed.  This value is reset to disabled after each update.
