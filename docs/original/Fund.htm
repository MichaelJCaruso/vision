<h3><a name="overview">Overview</a></h3>
<p>
The information used in the decision making process can be integrated
from many disparate sources.  Commercial sources of public
information such as economic, demographic, financial, and
product data are often combined with internally generated data such
as operating statistics and forecasts.  A fundamental requirement of
any database management system is that it provide a consistent
framework in which to structure your information.  
<p>
Many database management systems are designed around the individual
databases you use.  Vision assumes that the data provided in the
commercial and internal databases represents only one part of your
information resource.  As an object-oriented database management
system, Vision allows you to store data and the rules for
interrelating and using this information.  In addition, Vision treats
the dimensions of time and currency as integral components of your database.  
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="basic">Basic Terminology</a></h3>
<p>
<a name="objects"><b>Objects</b>
</a>
are the fundamental building block in Vision.  For example,
the number 3, the country Great Britain, GM's common stock, and the
baseball player Babe Ruth can all be thought of as Objects.  Objects
are the basic unit of information representation.  
<p>
A <a name="property"><b>Property</b></a>
is an attribute of an object whose value can be assigned
and updated.  For example, the properties of a company could include
its sales, earnings, and name.  The properties of a country could
include its gross national product and official languages. 
<p>
A <b>Method</b>
is an operation which can be performed on an object.  For
example, you could count the number of characters in a string,
produce a balance sheet for a company, and compute a batting average
for a baseball player.  
<p>
Vision is designed around the concept of communicating objects.
Objects interact with one another via a process known as <b>Sending a
Message</b>.  A <a href="#message"><b>Message</b></a>
is a request for an object to return the value of
one of its properties or execute one of its methods.  
The object receiving the request is known as the
<b>Recipient Object</b>.
The only way to interact with an Object is
through one of its messages.
Messages can ensure the modularity of the system
because they specify the type of operation desired, but not how that
operation should be accomplished for a particular type of object.  
<p>
The nature of an object's messages depends on the type of object it
represents.  Objects representing numbers understand messages that
compute arithmetic functions; however, it would not be appropriate to
define a property <i>sales</i> for a number (i.e., the number 3 does not
have a sales value).  <i>Sales</i> is a meaningful property to define for a
company; however, it would not be meaningful to add two companies
(e.g., GM + Ford) directly, although it is meaningful to think about
adding the sales values of these companies.  
<p>
It is useful to classify objects based on common properties and
operations.  For example, GM, Xerox, and IBM have the same properties
(e.g., sales, earnings, company name) and respond in the same way to
specific operations.  A 
<a href="#class"><b>Class</b></a>
is used to describe a group of similar
objects.  GM, Xerox, and IBM are Objects that could belong to a class
known as <i>Company</i>.  The United States, Great Britain, and Germany are
objects that could belong to a class known as <i>Country</i>.  3, 17.2, and
-.23 are objects that belong to a class known as <i>Number</i>.  
<p>
Each individual object is known as an 
<a href="#instance"><b>Instance</b></a> of the class.
Each instance of a class has a distinct value for each of the properties
defined for its class.  All instances of a class will respond to the
same set of messages, using the same methodology for carrying out any
of its operations.  

Perhaps the easiest way to understand the relationships among
classes, instances, and messages is to think of them in terms of a
table.  Each class can be thought of as a separate table.  The
instances of the class form the rows of the table.  The messages of
the class form the columns in the table.  A sample tabular
representation for the class Company is shown below:  
<p>
<pre>
                        <Font Size = +1> <b>Company Class</b> </Font>
<ul>
      <img src="fund1.jpg" lowsrc="fund1.jpg" alt="Tabular representation for Company" ></ul>
</pre>
<p>
This tabular organization is similar to the relational database
model.  However, in most relational systems, the actual data that can
be found for the values in the columns are restricted to a fixed set
of simple data types:  integer, real, string, and date.  No such
restriction exists in Vision.  For example, all companies are part of
an industry.  In the relational model, the value of industry would
probably be stored as a string or number in a company table.  This
value would then be used to query an industry table in order to
access information about a company's industry.  In Vision, the object
representing the company's industry is stored directly as the
value of the industry property.  As a result, the simple 
expression:<pre><tt><b>
     gm industry name 
</b></tt></pre>
could be used to access the name of GM's industry.
<p>
By providing a mechanism for linking tables, Vision offers additional
modeling power not present in relational systems.  Class
<a name="specialization"><b>Specialization</b>
</a>
provides a means for defining a new class that
<a name="inherits"><b>Inherits</b>
</a>
common properties and operations from another class.  A
class that is a specialization of another class is called a <b>Subclass</b>.
For example, bank companies are similar to industrial companies in
many ways, yet they have certain characteristics that are unique to
banks.  You may want to create a class <i>BankCompany</i> as a subclass of
the class <i>Company</i>.  The object <i>Citibank</i> could be defined as an
instance of this new class.  
<p>
A class inherits both the properties and methods of 
its <a name="superclass"><b>Superclass</b></a>
the class from which it was created.  All instances of a class are
also considered to be instances of its superclass.  This organization
is illustrated below:  
<p>
<pre>
<Font Size = +1><b>          Bank Company Class         Company Class</b></Font>

<ul>            <img src="fund2.jpg" lowsrc="fund2.jpg" alt="Instances Hierarchy" ></ul></pre>
<p>
New properties and methods may be defined by the subclass.  For
example, banks have a value for outstanding loan balance and standard
companies do not.  The property <i>loansOut</i> could be defined for the
class <i>BankCompany</i> to record loan balance values for banks.  The
company <i>GM</i> would not recognize the message <i>loansOut</i>
because it is not
a bank company.  The company <i>Citibank</i> would respond to this message
because it is a bank company.  Both <i>GM</i> and 
<i>Citibank</i> would respond to
any messages defined for the class <i>Company</i>, such as name and sales.  
<p>
A subclass may also redefine a method that is defined by its
superclass.  If a method is redefined by a subclass, instances of the
subclass will use the new method.  
<p>
New classes are always created as a subclass of an existing class.  A
subclass is in all respects a class and can therefore have subclasses
itself.  For example, the class <i>SavingsAndLoan</i> can be created as a
specialization of the class <i>BankCompany</i>.  
<p>
A class actually has a sequence of classes from which it inherits
properties and methods not defined by the class itself.  This
sequence begins with a class' superclass and continues with its
superclass' superclass, and so on.  The inheritance chain continues
until the class named <i>Object</i> is encountered.  The class <i>Object</i>
defines messages that are available to all objects in the system.  
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="message">Properties, Methods, and Messages - Overview</a></h3>
<p>
This section provides a basic overview for defining messages.  More
<a href="Messages.htm">detailed information</a> is available.
<p>
In the Vision language, objects communicate with one another by
sending messages.  The instances of a class all respond to the same
messages.  The message determines what type of operation the
recipient object should perform.  The recipient object's class
determines the manner in which to actually perform the operation
indicated by the message.  
<p>
For example, the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     gm sales 
</b></tt></pre>
sends the message <i>sales</i> to the company named <i>gm</i>.  
The definition of the message <i>sales</i> for the class 
<i>Company</i> may simply look up the value
of GM's sales property.  Alternatively, the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     autoIndustry sales 
</b></tt></pre>
sends the message <i>sales</i> to the industry named <i>autoIndustry</i>.
The definition of the message <i>sales</i> for the class 
<i>Industry</i> could be a
method that computes the total aggregate sales for all companies
defined to be a part of the automotive industry.  
<p>
Four types of message can be defined:
<p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><a href="#fixed">Fixed Properties</a>
<li><a href="#ts">Time Varying Properties</a>
<li><a href="#constant">Class Constants</a>
<li><a href="#method">Methods</a>
</ul>
<p>
You do not need to know what type of message has been defined in
order to use the message.  In all cases, the form:<pre><tt><b>
     object messageName 
</b></tt></pre>
is used to request that the recipient object carry out the specific
function indicated by the message.
<p>
<a name="fixed">
<b>Fixed Properties</b></a> are defined for storing information that does not
need to be maintained over time.  The general form for creating a
fixed property is:<pre><tt><b>
     className defineFixedProperty: 'propertyName' ;
</b></tt></pre>
where <i>className</i> 
is the name of the class for which you are defining the property and
<i>propertyName</i> is the name of the message which will be used to access
the property.
<p>
For example, you could define a property to store the year in which a
company was founded as shown below:<pre><tt><b>
     Company defineFixedProperty: 'yearFounded' ;
</b></tt></pre>
The value of a property for any instance of the class
is <a href="clNA.htm"><i>NA</i></a> by 
<a name="default">default</a>.
The <i>yearFounded</i> property can be 
<a name="update">updated</a> for instances of the class
<i>Company</i> as illustrated below:<pre><tt><b>
     gm :yearFounded <- 1935 ;
</b></tt></pre>
You place the : character in front of the property name to indicate that
you want to return the <a name="intensional"><b>Intensional Form</b>
of the property.  This form
responds to a variety of messages including the assignment message
which is used to update the property.  When the : is not prepended to
the property name, the value of <i>yearFounded</i> for <i>gm</i> 
is accessed:<pre><tt><b>
     gm yearFounded 
</b></tt></pre>
<p>
<a name="ts">  </a>
You may want to retain the values for a property over time.  The
general form for creating a <b>Time Varying Property</b> is:<pre><tt><b>
     className define: 'propertyName' ;
</b></tt></pre>
where <i>className</i> is the name of the class for which you are 
defining the property and <i>propertyName</i> 
is the name of the message which will be used to access the property.
<p>
For example, you could define a property to track company sales over
time as shown below:  <pre><tt><b>
     Company define: 'sales' ;
</b></tt></pre>
Initially, this time series property will not have any points in it
for any instance of the class and the value of this property will be
<a href="clNA.htm"><i>NA</i></a>.
The sales values for <i>gm</i> for 1993, 1994, and 1995 could be 
updated as illustrated below:<pre><tt><b>
     gm :sales asOf: 93 put: 96371.63 ; 
     gm :sales asOf: 94 put: 102813.00 ; 
     gm :sales asOf: 95 put: 101781.00 ; 
</b></tt></pre>
Again, you
place the : character in front of the property name to return it in
a form that can be updated.  In this case, the <i>asOf:put:</i> message
is used to update the time series property.
<p>
The sales values can be accessed as shown below:<pre><tt><b>
     gm sales               
</b></tt></pre>
returns the most recent sales and<pre><tt><b>
     gm :sales asOf: 94
</b></tt></pre>
returns the sales as of year-end 1994.  A time series property
returns its value as of the current evaluation date which is the
current date by default.  The <i>asOf:</i> message can be sent to
the intensional form of a time series (i.e., the form returned by
prepending the : character) to override the default access date.
<p>
<a name="constant"><b>Class Constants</b></a>
are defined for storing information that is identical for all instances of a
class.  The general form for creating a class constant is:<pre><tt><b>
     className define: 'constantName' toBe: object ;
</b></tt></pre>
where <i>className</i> is the name of the class for which you are defining
the class constant and <i>constantName</i> is the name of the message which
will be used to access the constant for any instance of the class and
<i>object</i> is the object which should be returned whenever this message
is sent to any instance of this class.
<p>
For example, the message <i>isCompany</i> could be defined to return the
<i>Boolean</i> object <i>TRUE</i> for all companies as shown below:<pre><tt><b>
     Company define: 'isCompany' toBe: TRUE ;
</b></tt></pre>
The message can be defined to return <i>FALSE</i> for all other objects as
shown below:<pre><tt><b>
     Object define: 'isCompany' toBe: FALSE ;
</b></tt></pre>
This message can be evaluated for <i>gm</i> using the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     gm isCompany 
</b></tt></pre>
This expression returns the value <i>TRUE</i>.  The expression:<pre><tt><b>
     3 isCompany 
</b></tt></pre>
returns the value <i>FALSE</i>.
<p>
<a name="method"><b>Methods</b></a>
are used to define procedures.  The general form for creating
a method is:<pre><tt><b>
     className defineMethod: 
     [ | methodName | 
         . . . 
     ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
where <i>className</i> is the name of the class for which you are
defining the method and <i>methodName</i> is the name of the
message which will be used to execute the method.
<p>
For example, a method to compute the price to earnings ratio for a
company can be written as shown below:<pre><tt><b>
     Company defineMethod: 
     [ | peRatio | 
       price / earnings 
     ] ; 
</b></tt></pre>
This method can be executed for the company <i>gm</i> using the 
expression:<pre><tt><b>
     gm peRatio 
</b></tt></pre>
This method assumes the messages <i>price</i> and <i>earnings</i> 
are defined as messages for the class <i>Company</i> as well.
<p>
As indicated earlier, you need not know that the message <i>sales</i> was
defined as a time series and that <i>peRatio</i> is actually a method that
accesses time series properties.  For example, the price to earnings
ratio for GM for 1994 can be accessed in the same manner as <i>sales</i>, as
illustrated below:  <pre><tt><b>
     gm :peRatio asOf: 94 
</b></tt></pre>
In this case, all data required by the 
<i>peRatio</i> method is accessed as of 1994.
<p>
Methods can be defined to require one or more parameters.  
The general form for creating a multi-parameter method is:<pre><tt><b>
     className defineMethod: 
     [ | methodWithParam1: p1 param2: p2 param3: p3 ... | 
         . . . 
     ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
where <i>className</i> is the name of the class for which you
are defining the method and
<i>methodNameWithParam1:param2:param3:</i>
is the name of a three parameter method which will be used to 
execute the method.
<p>
For example, a method to compute the price to earnings ratio for a 
company using a supplied price could be written as shown below:<pre><tt><b>
     Company defineMethod: 
     [ | peRatioWithPrice: inputPrice | 
       inputPrice / earnings 
     ] ; 
</b></tt></pre>
This method can be executed for <i>gm</i> using the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     gm peRatioWithPrice: 73.25 
</b></tt></pre>
This method assumes the message <i>earnings</i> is defined as a message
for the class <i>Company</i> and divides the supplied price by this value.
<p>
The <a href="#intensional">intensional form</a>
of a message was briefly introduced earlier as a way
to update properties.  Another use of this form is for
viewing the definition of a method.  For example:<pre><tt><b>
     gm :peRatio 
</b></tt></pre>
displays the definition of the method <i>peRatio</i> instead of evaluating
it.  If you wish to display the definition of a method that has
multiple parameters, you must supply "dummy" values for each
parameter.  For example, the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     gm :peRatioWithPrice: 0 
</b></tt></pre>
displays the definition of the <i>peRatioWithPrice:</i> method.  If the
method has several parameters, you only need to place the ":"  in
front of the first one to display its contents, but you must supply a
value for each parameter.  
<p>

<h3><a name="class">Classes and Instances - Overview</a></h3>
<p>
This section provides a basic overview for defining classes and
instances.  More
<a href="Classes.htm">detailed information</a> is available.
<p>
<b>Classes</b> provide a basic tool for organizing your information.  Vision
comes with many built-in classes including <i>Number</i>, <i>String</i>,
<i>Date</i>, <i>List</i>, and 
<i>TimeSeries</i>.  All instances of a class respond to the same
set of messages and use the same set of methods to do so.  All
instances of a class have the same number of properties and use the
same names to refer to them.  
<p>
You can define new classes as needed as illustrated below:<pre><tt><b>
     !Company <- Object createSubclass ;
</b></tt></pre>
New classes are always created as a subclass of an existing class.  
Any number of subclasses can be created.  For example:<pre><tt><b>
     !BankCompany <- Company createSubclass ; 
     !InsuranceCompany <- Company createSubclass ; 
     !SavingsAndLoan <- BankCompany createSubclass ; 
     !Industry <- Object createSubclass ;
</b></tt></pre>
The resultant class hierarchy is illustrated below:
<pre>
<ul>            <img src="fund3.jpg" lowsrc="fund3.jpg" alt="Sample Inheritance Hierarchy" ></ul>
                            <b>Sample Inheritance Hierarchy</b></pre>

<p>
The <i>showInheritance</i> message is used to 
display the class hierarchy for a specific class.  For example:<pre><tt><b>
     Company showInheritance
</b></tt></pre>
All objects respond to the message 
<i>instanceList</i> by returning an object representing the list of all 
the instances in a class.  All <i>List</i> objects respond to the
message <i>count</i>.  Therefore, the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Company instanceList count 
</b></tt></pre>
returns the number of instances in the class Company.  
This count should be one immediately after the class has been created.
<p>   
The <a name="instance"><i>createInstance</i></a>
message is used to create a new instance
for a class.  For example:<pre><tt><b>
     !ibm <- Company createInstance ; 
     !gm <- Company createInstance ; 
     !citibank <- BankCompany createInstance ; 
</b></tt></pre>
<p>
A subclass inherits both the properties and the methods of its
superclass.  The objects <i>gm</i> and <i>ibm</i> will respond to
all <i>Company</i>
messages.  The object <i>citibank</i> will respond to all
<i>BankCompany</i>
messages which includes the set of messages defined for the class
<i>Company</i>.  
<p>
New properties, constants, and methods may be defined by the
subclass.  For example, you can define a property <i>loansOut</i> for the
class <i>BankCompany</i>:<pre><tt><b>
     BankCompany define: 'loansOut' 
</b></tt></pre>
The object <i>gm</i> would not recognize the message 
<i>loansOut</i> because it is
a <i>Company</i>.  The object <i>citibank</i> 
will respond to this message because it is a <i>BankCompany</i>.  
<p>
The subclass may also redefine a method that is defined by its
superclass.  If a method is redefined by a subclass, the instances of
the subclass will use the new method.  For example, a valid operation
to perform on a company is to generate its balance sheet.  The
message <i>balanceSheet</i> could be defined to mean collect the required
company data and produce a report in balance sheet format.  The
method to accomplish this operation would be defined as part of the
class <i>Company</i>.  Since a bank company would require different data and
format for its balance sheet, this method could be redefined for the
class <i>BankCompany</i> as outlined below:<pre><tt><b>
     Company defineMethod: 
     [ | balanceSheet | 
       ...  get company data 
       ...  display company balance sheet format 
     ] ; 

     BankCompany defineMethod: 
     [ | balanceSheet | 
       ...  get bank company data 
       ...  display bank balance sheet format 
     ] ; 
</b></tt></pre>
All instances of the class <i>BankCompany</i> 
would use the second method when responding to the message
<i>balanceSheet</i>.  All other companies (i.e., non-bank companies) 
would use the first method, defined for the class 
<i>Company</i>.  
Although different methods would actually be executed, 
the request for <i>gm</i>'s and <i>citibank</i>'s balance sheet
would look identical:<pre><tt><b>
     gm balanceSheet ; 
     citibank balanceSheet ; 
</b></tt></pre>
In the first case, <i>gm</i> is the recipient object and
<i>balanceSheet</i> is the message.  Since <i>gm</i> is an instance
of the class <i>Company</i>, Vision would look for its definition
there.  In the second case, <i>citibank</i> is the recipient object
and <i>balanceSheet</i> is the message.  Since <i>citibank</i> is an
instance of the class <i>BankCompany</i>, Vision would look for its
definition there.  Since a definition of <i>balanceSheet</i> does exist for
the class <i>BankCompany</i>, it is used.  If no definition had been found,
the definition at the class <i>Company</i> would have been executed.  Notice
that you do not have to specifically request a different report based
on the type of company being analyzed.  
<p>
When a message is sent to an object, Vision searches for its
definition starting with the object's class.  If the message is not
found, the superclass' definition of the message is used.  If the
message is not defined by the superclass either, the superclass'
superclass is used, and so on through the inheritance chain.  The
search terminates at the class Object.  If the message definition is
still not found, an appropriate 
<a href="Error.htm#snf">error message</a> will be returned.  
<p>
It is sometimes useful to access the version of a message defined at
the superclass of the object.  All objects respond to the message
<i>super</i>.  For example, the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     citibank super balanceSheet 
</b></tt></pre>
creates Citibank's balance sheet as though it were a standard
company.

<h3><a name="review">Review</a></h3>
<p>
This section has introduced many new concepts.  The major points are
summarized below:  
<p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>To create a new class, send the message
<i>createSubclass</i> to an existing class:<pre><tt><b>
     !testClass <- Object createSubclass ;
</b></tt></pre>
<li> To display the inheritance hierarchy for a class:<pre><tt><b>
     testClass showInheritance ;
</b></tt></pre>
<li>To create a new instance of this class, send the class the 
<i>createInstance</i> message:<pre><tt><b>
     !test1 <- testClass createInstance ;
</b></tt></pre>
<li>To count the number of instances in a class:<pre><tt><b>
     testClass instanceList count 
</b></tt></pre>
<li>To create a new property for this class that does not vary over 
time:<pre><tt><b>
     testClass defineFixedProperty: 'startDate' ;
</b></tt></pre>
<li>To assign a value to this property:<pre><tt><b>
     test1 :startDate <- 951231 asDate ;
</b></tt></pre>
<li> To access this value:<pre><tt><b>
     test1 startDate 
</b></tt></pre>
<li>To create a new property for this class that varies over time:<pre><tt><b>
     testClass define: 'rating'  ;
</b></tt></pre>
<li>To assign values to this property for May, June, and July 1995:<pre><tt><b>
     test1 :rating asOf: 9505 put: 10 ; 
     test1 :rating asOf: 9506 put: 13 ; 
     test1 :rating asOf: 9507 put: 15 ; 
</b></tt></pre>
<li>To access the most recent value:<pre><tt><b>
      test1 rating 
</b></tt></pre>
<li>To access the June 1995 value:<pre><tt><b>
     test1 :rating asOf: 9506 
</b></tt></pre>
<li>To create a new method:<pre><tt><b>
     testClass defineMethod: 
     [ | sample | 
       "This Method Displays The Rating Value " print ; 
       rating print ; 
     ] ; 
</b></tt></pre>
<li>To execute this method:<pre><tt><b>
     test1 sample 
</b></tt></pre>
</ul>
<p>
A final example should be useful for unifying these concepts.
Suppose that the class <i>Industry</i> is defined to have three
properties:  <i>codeNumber</i>, <i>name</i>, and <i>growthRate</i>.
An object named <i>autos</i> is created as an instance of this class and its
values are initialized.  <pre><tt><b>
     !Industry <- Object createSubclass ; 
     Industry defineFixedProperty: 'codeNumber' ; 
     Industry defineFixedProperty: 'name' ; 
     Industry define: 'growthRate' ; 

     !autos <- Industry createInstance ;
     autos :codeNumber <- 3711 ; 
     autos :name <- "Automotive" ; 
     autos :growthRate asOf: 95 put: 10 ; 
</b></tt></pre>
<p>
The class <i>Company</i> can be defined to respond to the message
<i>industry</i> by returning the object representing the company's industry.
For example:  <pre><tt><b>
     !Company <- Object createSubclass ; 
     Company defineFixedProperty: 'industry' ; 
     !gm <- Company createInstance ; 
     !ford <- Company createInstance ; 
     !chrysler <- Company createInstance ; 

     gm :industry <- autos ; 
     ford :industry <- autos ; 
     chrysler :industry <- autos ; 
</b></tt></pre>    
The expression:<pre><tt><b>
     gm industry 
</b></tt></pre>    
returns the object representing the auto industry as its value.
The expression:<pre><tt><b>
     gm industry codeNumber
</b></tt></pre>    
returns the number <i>3711</i> and the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     gm industry name 
</b></tt></pre>    
returns the string <i>Automotive</i>.
<p>
A method could be defined for the class 
<i>Company</i> that computes expected sales based on the 
company's industry growth rate:<pre><tt><b>
     Company define: 'sales' ; 
     gm :sales asOf: 95 put: 1000 ; 
     ford :sales asOf: 95 put: 500 ; 
     chrysler :sales asOf: 95 put: 100 ; 

     Company defineMethod: 
     [ | expectedSales | 
       sales * ( 1 + industry growthRate / 100 ) 
     ]  ;
</b></tt></pre>    
The expression:<pre><tt><b>
     gm expectedSales 
</b></tt></pre>    
returns the value <i>1100</i>, the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     ford expectedSales 
</b></tt></pre>    
returns the value <i>550</i>, and the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     chrysler expectedSales 
</b></tt></pre>    
returns the value <i>110</i>.
<p>
Properties can refer to lists of objects.  For example:<pre><tt><b>
    Industry defineFixedProperty: 'companyList' ; 
    autos :companyList <- gm, ford, chrysler ; 
</b></tt></pre>    
can be used to assign a list of auto industry companies into the
<i>companyList</i> property defined for the class <i>Industry</i>.  
The expression:<pre><tt><b>
     autos companyList 
</b></tt></pre>    
returns the list of companies in the automotive industry.  
If you wanted instances of the class <i>Industry</i>
to respond to the message <i>sales</i> by computing the 
total sales for the companies in the industry, 
you could define this method as shown below:<pre><tt><b>
     Industry defineMethod: 
     [ | sales | 
       companyList total: [ sales ] 
     ]  ;
</b></tt></pre>    
The expression:<pre><tt><b>
     autos sales 
</b></tt></pre>    
computes the total sales for the automotive industry.  The 
expression:<pre><tt><b>
     gm industry sales 
</b></tt></pre>    
produces the same value.  The expression:<pre><tt><b>
     gm sales / gm industry sales * 100 
</b></tt></pre>    
computes GM's percentage of the automotive industry's sales.
