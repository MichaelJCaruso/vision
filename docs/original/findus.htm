<h3>Directions</h3>

<h4>From Logan Airport</h4>

Take the Massachusetts Turnpike ("Mass Pike") west to Exit 17
(Newton).  After the stoplight at the end of the exit, go straight
across the intersection onto Washington
Street.  You will see a pedestrian stoplight.  One Gateway Center is directly to your
left (the first building on the left).  Other landmarks include
Citizens Bank (on left), Pizzeria Uno (on right) and a bus stop (on right).
<p>

<ul type=disc>
<li>On-street parking spaces.<p>
<li>A parking garage just beyond Applebee's Restaurant on the left.
<i>Please note: this garage is undergoing renovation and may be

<li>A metered parking lot halfway around the rotary (over the Mass
Pike) on the right.
</ul>
<h4>From the West</h4>
Take the Massachusetts Turnpike ("Mass Pike") east to Exit 17
(Newton).  At the end of the ramp, move over to the far left lane.
At the fork, stay to the left.  As you merge onto the bridge (going
back over the Mass Pike), stay in the middle lane.
Bear to the left (NOT a hard left, however, as this will take you
back onto the Mass Pike heading west) onto Washington Street. 
You will see a pedestrian stoplight.  One Gateway Center is directly to your
left (the first building on the left).  Other landmarks include
Citizens Bank (on left), Pizzeria Uno (on right) and a bus stop (on right).
