Vision is an object-oriented, analytical database management technology that has been used to support mission critical, production systems for clients in a cross-section of industries including investment management, international trade, health care, and media research.  Vision is object-oriented, yet its heritage originates from database management theory and practice. This union of two distinct and effective information models gives Vision unmatched capabilities in storing, manipulating, and analyzing large, complex, time-sensitive databases.

At Vision's core is a scaleable, distributed database management engine.  An object-oriented programming language is built into the database engine, providing a single, integrated environment for defining, storing, and analyzing data. Vision is fully extensible by its users.  By integrating data and programs into one environment, Vision offers users unparalleled analytical power and real-world modeling capabilities, complementing the data collection and transactions processing capabilities of relational databases and greatly surpassing the analytical capabilities of OLAPs and other add-ons.
